\chapter{Active Contours Without Edges}
Where models such as GAC relied on an edge indicator function and thus are susceptible to related issues such as computing gradients (highly problematic with noisy images) and are highly dependent on initial conditions, the active contours without edges (ACWE) model proposed by Chan and Vese \cite{chan2001active}
