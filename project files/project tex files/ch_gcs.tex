\chapter{Globally Convex Segmentation}
Numerical experiments in the two models, GAC and ACWE, show that there is certainly room for improvement from the modelling perspective. Of particular concern are the models nack for finding and getting stuck at local minima (by design, in case of the GAC model), and therefore the solution attained is dependent on the initial contour. These issues are address by Chan, Esedo\={g}lu, and Nikolova \cite{chan2006algorithms}, and their ideas further refined by Bresson et al \cite{bresson2007fast}, in what they referred to as the convexification of the ACWE model.

First, it is important to understand the nature of the non-convexity in the ACWE model. Restating the optimization problem in terms of indicator functions, we have 
\begin{align*}
\min_{\Sigma\subset\Omega} \eacwe(\ind_\Sigma(x)), c_1, c_2; \lambda) 
\end{align*}

Because of the nonconvex nature,
